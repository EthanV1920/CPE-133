# CPE-133 Introduction to Digital Design

Ethan Vosburg (Fall 2023 at Cal Poly SLO)

## Description of Course

CPE 133 is a first course in digital design that covers computing fundamentals such as number systems, various forms of representing  logic, common logic devices, binary math, sequential circuits and finite state machines. The lab portion of the course requires applying lecture theory to practical designs of logic circuitry. (Source: Canvas Shell Professor Gary Perks)

## Equipment Used

In this class the Basys 3 Development Board will be used to introduce students to the fundamentals of working with a FPGA (Felid Programmable Gate Array)

- [3D Printed Case for Basys 3](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3094814/makes) (Optional)

## Software Used

In this class, Vivado will be used to program the FPGA and deploy programs and configurations on to the Basys 3 board. In the course, System Verilog will be used in order to program the chips which bears syntactical resemblance to the programming language C however, instead of providing instructions for a microprocessor, the language is used to define logic on the FPGA.
